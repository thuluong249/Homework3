## Created A Password Generator.

* At first i created All the code that i can use for my Assignment. 

* After that I need to create the code to ask the user input, ask for how many characters that user want to use for their password and the length have to choose from 8 to 28 characters.

* To use all the special chatacters I created a list of Array included using the uppercases, lowercases, numbers and symbols.

* Using the variable code with confirm to ask the user to use all the special characters that I already created.

* And, if the user choose something unclear or not requires it will show the alert for the user to choose the right one. 

* Created a function for the generate password with if variable for all the password code to run in the browser.
